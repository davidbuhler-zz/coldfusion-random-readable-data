++++   GETTING STARTED WITH GAZOO
++++   
++++   1) Unzip the package folder to C:\ColdFusion8\wwwroot\gazoo. If you're using a different version of
++++   Coldfusion, you'll need to change the directory path in Application.cfc. If you're using Coldfusion MX 6.1,
++++   you will need to change the Application.cfc to Application.cfm.
++++   
++++   2) On a similar note, if you're using a version of ColdFusion, other than CF8, you'll need to change the following in Application.cfc:
++++   	<cfset request.gazoo_source_directory_path = "C:\ColdFusion8\wwwroot\gazoo\images\untouched\" 		/>
++++   	<cfset request.gazoo_output_directory_path = "C:\ColdFusion8\wwwroot\gazoo\images\manipulated\" 	/>
