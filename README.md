# Highly Random, Highly Readable Data for Coldfusion / J2EE Developers

A Coldfusion Utility that generates highly random, highly readable data

General testing, unit testing, and load-testing are complicated without random data with various possibilities to test against.

Client presentations are made more difficult without readable information that shows how a final website or software application may display data. 

The Coldfusion Random Data Generator tries to simplify both by providing highly random, highly readable data. 

Random Data Generation includes the following:

* Images (now includes a batch image converter)
* Regular Sized Images
* Thumbnail images
* Image sets (regular/thumbnail together)
* HTML
* Company Names 
* Email Addresses
* Passwords
* First Names
* Last Names
* Phone Numbers
* Dollar Amounts 
* Address 1s 
* Address 2s 
* Cities
* State Names
* State Abbreviations
* Ages 
* Social Security Numbers 
* Booleans
* Integers
* Bits 
* Website URLs (including IPs)
* Text 
* Dangerous characters that should be removed (usefulf or OWASP testing)
* Strings 
* Zip Codes (with the optional zip+4 format) 
* Zip Codes By State 
* Dates within a range (useful for birthdays) 
* Generic Dates 
* Start Dates with subsequent End Dates 
* Times
* UUIDs
